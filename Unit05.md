**Unit 5: Project Execution** <span id="5"></span> 

*<span lang="EN-US">Execution involves building the deliverables and
controlling the project scope and costs.  Risks must also be managed
during this phase.  Control mechanisms should be in place to control
issues and problems as well as to ensure quality.  Once the project
initiation and planning is complete, the execution phase begins. 
Ideally the project plan has been approved and base-lined so that the
actual work can start. </span>*  
  
 <span lang="EN-US"> *This phase includes the coordination of resources
to perform the activities outlined in the plan.  The project manager
must unify all associated areas of the project and engage all
stakeholders, project staff, customers, and other resources to achieve a
successful outcome.  Report gathering is performed regularly during this
phase to analyze ongoing status, task changes, and other variances to
the plan.  Administratively, the project manager must complete or
coordinate all status reports to keep the organization abreast of
project standing.  The majority of the project’s tasks are performed
during this phase. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn the core of project management through a
review of the organizational techniques required to make sure
deliverables are completed on time and on budget. *</span>
