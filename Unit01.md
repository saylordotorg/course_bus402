**Unit 1: Project Management Defined** <span id="1"></span> 
*According to* A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
*(2008), a project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a
unique product, service, or result.”  The broader definition states that
a project is “an endeavor that requires an organized set of work efforts
that are planned in a level of detail that is progressively elaborated
as more information is discovered.”  Projects should result in
developing a new product or service, improving or modifying existing
goods, services, and procedures.  The bringing together of skilled
resources to create something new or different using effective
management processes is the cornerstone of project management. In
practice, project management is defined as “the application of
knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet
the project requirements” (PMBOK, 2008, p. 6). A project manager should
be able to identify project requirements, address the various needs,
concerns, and expectations of the stakeholders as the project is planned
and carried out, and also to balance the competing project constraints
in terms of project scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources and
risk.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will be given a foundation in project management
through explorations of the history of the discipline, as well as a
discussion of the contemporary frameworks used by organizations today. *
