**Unit 6: Project Implementation and Closure** <span id="6"></span> 

*<span lang="EN-US">The final phase of the project life cycle is the
implementation and closure phase. This includes winding down tasks,
implementing the product or service to the client or internally within
the organization, releasing staff and conducting a lessons-learned
review.  This phase is very crucial to preventing the project from
moving beyond the original scope and budget as defined in the baseline
project plan.  There must be acceptance of the project deliverables and
feedback must be sought regarding project performance.  Evaluation
reports must also be created and lessons-learned, or post-mortem meeting
must be held to discuss project strengths and weaknesses.  Outstanding
contributors are also recognized during this phase and the achievements
of the overall project team are celebrated.</span>*  
  
 <span lang="EN-US"> *This unit will review how to close down projects
and use the insights gained to make improvements going forward; it will
also discuss how to celebrate the team for peak-performance and how to
seek and obtain customer feedback and acceptance.*</span>
