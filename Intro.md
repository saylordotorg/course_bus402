Course Syllabus for "BUS402: Project Management"
------------------------------------------------

*A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge* defines *project*
as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service,
or result.  The temporary nature of projects indicates a definite
beginning and end.  The end is reached when the project’s objectives
have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its
objectives will not or cannot be met, or when the need for the project
no longer exists.” (PMBOK, 2008, p. 5).  The discipline of project
management has various definitions.  Some describe it as a systematic
method of planning and guiding a project from start to finish, while
others have defined project management as a methodical approach of
achieving targets and goals while optimizing the use of resources such
as people, money, time, and space.  Some have referred to project
management as the ability to be open and to elicit commitments through
effective communication regarding how team members are willing to
participate.  More specifically, the PMBOK (2008) defines project
management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and
techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.” (p.
6).  Project management is therefore accomplished through the
appropriate application and integration of systematic and logically
grouped project management processes within five process groups
including *initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling,*
as well as *closing.*  Thus, good project managers should be able to
understand and effectively execute all project management processes for
each unique project while communicating effectively within their own
teams as well as with all stakeholders across the organizational
network.  Project managers must also be artful at delegation, and they
must understand that a cohesive team that works well together is
critical to their success.  While many associate project management with
military logistics, information technology, and construction, project
management procedures are integrated in some aspect of most
occupations.  Today, in addition to their normal duties, employees are
often expected to take on additional assignments to get the job done on
time and under budget.  This course will walk you through the nuts and
bolts of project management.  From understanding the project life cycle
to setting priorities and expectations to controlling expenses and
reporting results, project management touches several resources within
organizations.  You will examine roles and environments and various
techniques of planning, evaluation, and control.   An overview of the
tools used in contemporary project management will also be discussed
throughout the course.

Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in later
units. You will also need to complete:

-   Unit 1 Assessment

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments, activities, and discussion board
assignments listed above.  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take approximately **136.75
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 27.25 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1  (a
total of 3.25 hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.2 and 1.3 (a total of
4.75 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.4 (a total of 4.5 hours) on
Wednesday night; etc.   
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **Please read through each unit carefully.  Then,
read each resource and listen to the assigned lectures.  The assessments
found in some subunits will help affirm your understanding of the course
content.  Try to take comprehensive notes on each resource.  When taking
notes, it may help to pay particular attention to the learning outcomes
set out at the beginning of each unit.  Reviewing these notes will be
useful as you prepare and study for your Final Exam.
