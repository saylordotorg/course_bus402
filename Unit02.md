**Unit 2: Project Life Cycle** <span id="2"></span> 

*<span lang="EN-US">Every project has a life cycle, or a series of
milestones and accomplishments that must be met throughout the project.
 The first stage of the project management life cycle (PML) is
initiation.  In this stage, the project is chartered and mission
statements as well as the project’s overall goals are defined.  The
project manager is identified and the team is assembled.  In this stage,
some organizations draft a mission statement just for the project. 
</span>*  
  
 <span lang="EN-US"> *The next phase is the planning phase.  During this
second phase, tasks are assigned and details are provided to describe
each task.  Project deliverables are also identified.  In phase three,
prototypes are developed, the project is tested, quality is reviewed,
and production is initiated.  This is called the execution phase.  It is
also referred to as the control or implementation phase. *  
  
 *The last phase of a project is closure. Reviews are held when the
project is complete. During this last phase, one has the opportunity to
review lessons learned and to archive data and records. <span
style="color:red">  </span>Customer feedback is sought regarding the
life cycle and delivery of the system.  In this unit, you will learn
that projects should follow a systematic approach with a defined
beginning and ending. *</span>
