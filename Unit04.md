**Unit 4: Project Initiation and Planning** <span id="4"></span> 

*<span lang="EN-US">Project initiation is the most critical phase in the
project life cycle, as it is the first phase of the overall initiative.
During this phase, the scope is defined and the team and other resources
are positioned.  The organization defines the objectives, purpose, and
mission of the project as well as determines the deliverables and
expected outcomes.  The project manager is responsible for creating the
baseline project plan.  In this unit, you will learn about the project
charter and the various frameworks and tools that can be utilized in
this phase to create the proper foundation for project
success. </span>*<span lang="EN-US"></span>
