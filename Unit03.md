**Unit 3: Organizational Design** <span id="3"></span> 

*<span lang="EN-US">Many businesses have struggled with organizing
projects under a separate organizational system than their ongoing
operations.  Upon the chartering of a project, organizations must
determine how their project will be implemented.  In many cases,
traditional organization designs fall short of providing the type of
structure needed for successful project implementation.  Thus, the
manner in which a project is organized may change with each new charter
through a temporary design project which fits the current project’s
needs.   </span>*  
  
 <span lang="EN-US"> *There are various project management systems that
provide the proper framework for implementing project activities within
organizations.  This unit will discuss how project managers can balance
the needs of both the overall organization and the project by utilizing
effective design techniques.*</span>
